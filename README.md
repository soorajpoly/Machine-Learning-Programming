Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and BiLSTM Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) models for classifying text sentiments into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.

Features

	•	Data preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization.
	•	Sentiment analysis using NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
	•	Deep learning models implemented with TensorFlow/Keras:
	•	LSTM Model.
	•	BiLSTM Model.
	•	Evaluation metrics:
	•	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
	•	Confusion Matrix.
	•	Visualizations:
	•	Sentiment distribution bar charts.
	•	Accuracy and loss line charts for both models.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Python 3.7 or higher
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Required Python libraries:



Running the Notebook

jupyter notebook

Open the sentiment_analysis.ipynb file.

	4.	Run the Notebook:
	•	Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
	•	Model outputs, visualizations, and evaluation metrics will be displayed inline.

Results

	•	LSTM Model:
	•	Accuracy: XX%
	•	Validation Loss: XX
	•	BiLSTM Model:
	•	Accuracy: XX%
	•	Validation Loss: XX

Refer to the notebook for detailed results and visualizations.
